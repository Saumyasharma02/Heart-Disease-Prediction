# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🏥 Project Overview
This project aims to predict **heart disease** using **tabular patient data** and **Machine Learning models**.  
The dataset contains various **clinical features**, and the objective is to classify whether a patient has **heart disease** or not.

## 🔬 Machine Learning Models Used
The following models were applied and compared:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression**

Since the dataset was **imbalanced**, we used **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** to improve model performance.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of **patient medical records**, including features like:
- **Age**
- **Sex**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Cholesterol Levels**
- **Heart Rate**
- **ECG Results**
- **Exercise-induced Angina**
- **ST Depression**
- **Thalassemia**
- **Other relevant features...**

**Dataset Source:**  
- 📁 Kaggle / Mendeley dataset  
- **Number of Samples:** Large dataset (post-SMOTE processing)
- **Data Format:** `.csv`
